# AI-Powered SOAP Note Generator
## Main Idea
An AI-powered tool that generates structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) medical notes from audio or text inputs. The tool can also suggest potential diagnoses using ICD-10 codes and recommend relevant follow-up questions for improved clinical decision-making.

## Why This Matters
Reduce Physician Burnout
Automates note-taking to save time and minimize repetitive tasks for doctors.

Seamless EHR Integration
Standardized notes allow for easy data exchange between Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.

Improved Workflow & Comfort
Physicians can continue using their preferred input methods (e.g., dictation, notes), while the tool structures and organizes content automatically.

## Implementation Overview
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python with Flask-RESTful

AI Engine: Fine-tune LLaMA models for medical context processing, intend to use University GPUs.
